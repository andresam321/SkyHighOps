## SkyHighOps Aviation

SkyHighOps Aviation is an advanced airplane management system designed to enhance airport efficiency. This system enables precise management of airport spaces by allowing users to add and manage parking spots and dynamically assign or unassign aircraft to these spots for optimal space utilization. It also supports the registration of aircraft owners, maintaining clear ownership records. A forthcoming feature will handle fuel requests, enabling employees to view, accept, or mark requests as pending, thereby improving operational response times. Built with Flask, React, Redux, PostgreSQL, Cloudinary, AWS, and Docker, SkyHighOps offers robustness, scalability, and a user-friendly interface, ensuring reliability and adaptability to evolving airport needs.
